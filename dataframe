Create a new python script to do the following;

Identify and download an open source data file from data.gov (e.g., Consumer Complaints) that is in the csv format. Read the file into a dataframe of pandas. Select one or more rows or columns and print the contents. Show the print results. Pull the script and printed results.

Note: you will need to use pandas package. Also, you must use encoding = 'latin1' if you use python 3.4
For example,
df = pd.read_csv(filename, encoding='latin1')
 where pd is the short form use of pandas (e.g., import pandas as pd) and df is a variable of type dataframe.
 
import pandas as pd
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIS407/Data_Analysis/master/Data/Titanic_train.csv'
titanic = pd.read_csv(url)
print('Passengers who survived on Titanic')
survived = titanic.query('Survived == 1')
print(survived)
